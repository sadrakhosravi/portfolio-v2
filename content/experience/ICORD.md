- Wrote a modern, performant, and robust TypeScript code to create a scalable native cross\-platform data acquisition software that would read data from NIRS sensors, apply calculations and filter, and would display it on 4 channels in real time. Stack: Electron, React, Node, and SQLite.
- Identified memory leaks in the React front\-end by comparing heap snapshots of the program in idle and heavy load situations.
- Re\-implemented a stable Hardware Access Layer in C++ and increased the NIRS sensor sampling rate from 25 to 100 samples/sec.
- Developed a data socket transfer feature in NodeJS that would transfer the sensorâ€™s real time data over TCP to other applications such as MATLAB, LabChart Lightning and other data acquisition software.
